The coffee is ground too finely and obstructs the system. T Set the grinder to a coarser setting (see chapter 4 ‘Prepara- tion – Adjusting the grinder’). The water hardness may not have been correctly set. T Perform descaling (see chapter 7 ‘Maintenance – Descaling the machine ’). There is dry ground coffee behind the coffee grounds container. The beans used are resulting in an above-average volume of ground coffee. T Reduce the coffee strength or choose a finer grinder setting. Grinder is making a very loud noise. There are foreign objects in the grinder. T Contact customer support in your country (see chapter 13 ‘JURA contact details / Legal information’).
