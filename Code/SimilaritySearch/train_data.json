Harmful substances such as heavy metals, chlorine or other pollutants can be detected in water everywhere. The modified granule of our filter cartridges always filters limescale to an optimum level (even when the water hardness is low) and reduces the level of all harmful substances more efficiently than ever before. Minerals and fluorides that are important for helping flavours to develop are fully retained in the water. The optimum stabilisation of limescale and efficient filtering of harmful substances always results in optimum water quality for a perfect coffee flavour."

Water quality and water hardness vary from place to place and depending on the time of day. With the pioneering new formula, the filter cartridges are ideally suited to mains water anywhere in the world. CLEARYL continuously delivers perfectly and freshly filtered water.

If the water is cold, please contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0345 658 9700.\nCheck the temperature of the cups. Cold cups will very quickly lower the temperature of the coffee. Try warming cups with some hot water and/or steam or by keeping them on the cup warming plate (if present).\nPre-heat the water circuit and filter by first dispensing one cup of coffee without putting in any coffee, so by dispensing only hot water. After that, start brewing coffee."
