Japanese tea is a high-quality green tea which boasts a fine, fresh, \u0093green\u0094 taste. Dispensed temperature: approx. 65 \u00b0C, brewing time: approx. 1.5 minutes. White tea is a green tea where only the young buds of the tea plant are used and processed very gently. White tea has a particularly mild taste. Dispensed temperature: approx. 70 \u00b0C, brewing time: approx. 2 minutes. Green tea gets its green colour from the leaves of the tea plant. The tea leaves are either roasted or steamed depending on the region. Green tea can be infused multiple times. Dispensed temperature: approx. 80 \u00b0C, brewing time: approx. 2.5 minutes. Black tea gets its dark colour and characteristic taste from the fermentation of tea leaves. Black tea can be enjoyed with a little lemon or milk. Dispensed temperature: approx. 97 \u00b0C, brewing time: approx. 3 minutes. Chai latte has its origins in traditional Ayurveda medicine as a black tea with typically Indian spices and milk. The milk mellows the spices and tops off the flavour experience. Dispensed temperature: approx. 97 \u00b0C, brewing time: approx. 3 minutes. Herbal tea is an aromatic infusion drink made up of dried leaves or fresh parts of plants. Dispensed temperature: approx. 97 \u00b0C, brewing time: approx. 8 minutes. Fruit tea is made from dried pieces of fruit and/or parts of plants, e.g. rose hip. The taste of the drink varies according to which plants are used and how they are blended. Lots of fruit teas are also flavoured. Dispensed temperature: approx. 97 \u00b0C, brewing time: approx. 8 minutes.",
