10.1 Tips for a hotter coffee
For hotter espresso coffee, you should:
• You are recommended to warm the cups before making 
coffee by rinsing them with a little hot water.
• Attach the filter holder to the appliance with the filter in 
place but without adding coffee. Using the same cup 
as will later be used to make the coffee, press the 1 cup 
button and deliver hot water into the cup to heat it.
• Raise the coffee temperature in the settings menu.
• Rest the cups you will be using on the cup warmer (A4) 
which becomes hot during operation.
10.2 How to prepare espresso coffee using preground coffee
1. Place the ground coffee filter (C2 or C3) in the filter holder 
(fig. 6). To make one coffee, use the filter with the 
symbol on the bottom, to make two coffees, use the filter 
with the symbol on the bottom.
2. To make just one coffee, place one level measure of preground coffee (about 7 g) in the filter (fig. 7). To make two 
coffees, place two loosely filled measures (about 7+7 g) of 
pre-ground coffee in the filter. Fill the filter a little at a time 
to prevent the pre-ground coffee from overflowing.
 Important: 
For correct operation, before filling with pre-ground coffee, 
make sure there are no coffee residues left in the filter from the 
last time you made coffee.
3. Distribute the pre-ground coffee evenly and press lightly 
with the presser (fig. 8).
Correct pressing of the pre-ground coffee is essential to 
obtain a good espresso. If you press too firmly, the coffee 
will be delivered slowly and will be strong. If you press 
too lightly, the coffee will be delivered quickly and will be 
weak.
4. Remove any excess coffee from the rim of the filter holder 
and attach the filter holder to the appliance. To attach correctly, align the filter holder handle with the INSERT symbol (fig. 9), attach the filter holder and rotate the handle 
towards the right until aligned with the CLOSE symbol.
