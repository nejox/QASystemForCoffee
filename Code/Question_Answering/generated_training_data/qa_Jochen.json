Let a full tank of water pass through the machine once or twice to clean it, without using paper filter or coffee. Making coffee: open the lid and fill the water tank with fresh cold water up to the desired level. There is a water-level indicator for 2–10 big cups / 3–15 small cups inside the water tank. Insert paper filter into filter basket and fill it with ground coffee. There is a gauge for recommended number of spoons of coffee next to the water gauge. For medium-strength coffee, one measuring spoon (approx. 6-7 g) per cup is sufficient. Close the water tank lid and place the jug (complete with lid) onto the warming plate. Start the machine with the ON/OFF switch. The power indicator light will come on and hot water will flow into the filter. When water has stopped flowing, the warming plate keeps the coffee hot until the machine is turned off with the ON/OFF switch. If the machine is not turned off manually, the Safety Auto-Off function turns it off after 40 minutes. If the jug is removed, the filter valve prevents coffee from dripping onto the warming plate. While boiling, the jug must not be removed for longer than 30 seconds or the filter will overflow.

We recommend using 1 coffee measuring scoop of ground coffee per cup, but use more or less to suit your taste. • Close the water reservoir and place the carafe in its position on the keep warm plate (6). • Plug the cord into an electrical outlet. • Press the START button (a) to start brewing immediately or press TIMER (b) to commence brewing at the pre-set time. • During brewing, the indicator light will flash continuously.

The removal of built-up calcium deposits from the water reservoir will help extend the life of your coffee maker and keep your coffee tasting great. Frequency will depend upon the hardness of your tap water and how often you use the coffee maker. You can use a commercially available decalcifying agent not affecting aluminum. We recommend using the Braun Descaling Solution (can be purchased in stores, through the Braun website, or by calling Customer Service). Note: The entire cleaning cycle including rinsing can take up to 45 minutes to complete. • Follow the package instructions of the decalcifying agent. • Place the empty carafe in its position on the keep warm plate (6). • Press the CALC button (c) to select the descaling program. • The green LED above the button will start flashing. • To start the descaling program press START (a). The green LED is still flashing. • When the descaling program has been completed, the green LED (c) will turn off. • Discard the cleaning solution and rinse the carafe thoroughly with clean water. • Fill the water reservoir with a full carafe (12 cups) of clean, fresh water.

We recommend using the Braun Descaling Solution (can be purchased in stores, through the Braun website, or by calling Customer Service). Note: The entire cleaning cycle including rinsing can take up to 45 minutes to complete. • Follow the package instructions of the decalcifying agent. • Place the empty carafe in its position on the keep warm plate (6). • Press the CALC button (c) to select the descaling program. • The green LED above the button will start flashing. • To start the descaling program press START (a). The green LED is still flashing. • When the descaling program has been completed, the green LED (c) will turn off. • Discard the cleaning solution and rinse the carafe thoroughly with clean water. • Fill the water reservoir with a full carafe (12 cups) of clean, fresh water. Run the coffee maker through two complete brew cycles to flush the unit after descaling. Use a full carafe of fresh cold water each time. • Repeat the procedure as many times as necessary in order to reduce the brewing time per cup to a normal level.",

    "context": "10. HOW TO MAKE ESPRESSO COFFEE\n10.1 Tips for a hotter coffee\nFor hotter espresso coffee, you should:\n• You are recommended to warm the cups before making \ncoffee by rinsing them with a little hot water.\n• Attach the filter holder to the appliance with the filter in \nplace but without adding coffee. Using the same cup \nas will later be used to make the coffee, press the 1 cup \nbutton and deliver hot water into the cup to heat it.\n• Raise the coffee temperature in the settings menu.\n• Rest the cups you will be using on the cup warmer (A4) \nwhich becomes hot during operation.\n10.2 How to prepare espresso coffee using pre\u0002ground coffee\n1. Place the ground coffee filter (C2 or C3) in the filter holder \n(fig. 6). To make one coffee, use the filter with the \nsymbol on the bottom, to make two coffees, use the filter \nwith the symbol on the bottom.\n2. To make just one coffee, place one level measure of pre\u0002ground coffee (about 7 g) in the filter (fig. 7). To make two \ncoffees, place two loosely filled measures (about 7+7 g) of \npre-ground coffee in the filter. Fill the filter a little at a time \nto prevent the pre-ground coffee from overflowing.\n Important: \nFor correct operation, before filling with pre-ground coffee, \nmake sure there are no coffee residues left in the filter from the \nlast time you made coffee.\n3. Distribute the pre-ground coffee evenly and press lightly \nwith the presser (fig. 8).\nCorrect pressing of the pre-ground coffee is essential to \nobtain a good espresso. If you press too firmly, the coffee \nwill be delivered slowly and will be strong. If you press \ntoo lightly, the coffee will be delivered quickly and will be \nweak.\n4. Remove any excess coffee from the rim of the filter holder \nand attach the filter holder to the appliance. To attach cor\u0002rectly, align the filter holder handle with the INSERT sym\u0002bol (fig. 9), attach the filter holder and rotate the handle \ntowards the right until aligned with the CLOSE symbol.\n5. Place the cup or cups under the filter holder spouts (fig. \n10). \n6. Make sure the lights corresponding to the coffee buttons \nare on, then press the or coffee button. The \nappliance proceeds to make the coffee and delivery is in\u0002terrupted automatically.\n7. To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to \nleft.\n Danger of burns! \nTo avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the \nappliance is delivering coffee. Always wait for a few seconds \nafter delivery.\n10.3 How to make espresso coffee using pods\n Please note: \nUse pods conforming to the ESE standard, indicated on the pack \nby the following symbol. \nThe ESE standard is a system accepted by lead\u0002ing pod producers and enables espresso coffee \nto be prepared simply and cleanly.\n1. Place the filter for coffee pods (with the symbol on \nthe bottom) in the filter holder.\n2. Insert the pod, centring it as far as possible on the filter \n(fig. 11). Always follow the instructions on the pod pack to \nposition the pod on the filter correctly. \nProceed as described in points 4 to 6 in the previous section.\n Please note: \n• While the appliance is making coffee, delivery can be in\u0002terrupted at any moment by pressing the coffee button \npressed previously.\n• At the end of delivery (within 3 seconds), to increase the \namount of coffee in the cup, press and hold the coffee button pressed previously. Delivery is automatically interrupt\u0002ed after a few seconds.\n• To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to \nleft.\n Danger of burns! \nTo avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the \nappliance is delivering coffee. Always wait for a few seconds \nafter delivery.\n10.4 Programming the quantities of coffee in \nthe cup\nThe appliance is set by default to automatically deliver standard \nquantities. To change these quantities, proceed as follows:\n1. Place one or two cups under the filter holder spouts.\n2. Press and hold the button you want to programme (\nor ). The coffee maker starts delivering coffee and \nthe other coffee button flashes to indicate that the appli\u0002ance is in programming mode.\n3. Once the required quantity of coffee has been delivered \ninto the cup, release the button. Delivery stops and the \nlight flashes to indicate that the quantity has been saved \ncorrectly.\n4. When the two coffee lights come on steadily, the appliance \nis ready for use.\n11. HOW TO MAKE CAPPUCCINO\n1. Prepare the espresso coffees as described in the previous \nsections, using sufficiently large cups. To use tall glasses, \nremove the drip tray and stand the glasses on the glasses \ntray (A10),\n2. Press the button (fig. 12). The light flashes,\n3. In the meantime, fill a recipient with about 100 grams of \nmilk for each cappuccino to be prepared. For a denser more \neven froth, you must use skimmed or partially skimmed \nmilk at refrigerator temperature (about 5°C). In choosing \nthe size of the recipient, bear in mind that the milk doubles \nor triples in volume (fig. 13).\n4. Make sure the cappuccino maker selection ring (A14) is in \nthe \"CAPPUCCINO\" position (fig. 14),\n5. Wait for the light corresponding to the button to \ncome on steadily, indicating that the boiler has reached \nthe ideal temperature to produce steam.\n6. Position an empty container under the cappuccino maker \nand open the dial for a few seconds to eliminate any air left \nin the circuit. Close the dial again.\n7. Place the recipient containing the milk under the cappucci\u0002no maker.\n8. Immerse the cappuccino maker in the milk container. \nNever immerse the black ring(fig. 15). Turn the dial to the \nposition. Steam is delivered from the cappuccino \nmaker, giving the milk a creamy frothy appearance (fig. \n16). To obtain a creamier froth, immerse the cappuccino \nmaker in the milk and rotate the container with slow up\u0002ward movements.\n9. When the required temperature (the ideal is 60°C) and \nfroth density is reached, interrupt steam delivery by turn\u0002ing the steam dial clockwise.\n10. Pour the frothed milk into the cups containing the espresso \ncoffee prepared previously. The cappuccino is ready. Sweet\u0002en to taste and if desired, sprinkle the froth with a little \ncocoa powder.\nPlease note:\n• to prepare more than one cappuccino, first make all the \ncoffees then at the end prepare the frothed milk for all the \ncappuccinos,\n• to exit the steam function, press any button. The \nand lights flash to indicate that the temperature is \ntoo high to make coffee (see section \"Cooling the boiler”).\nYou should not deliver steam for more than \n60 seconds.\n12. MAKING HOT MILK\nTo make hot milk without froth, proceed as described in the \nabove section, making sure the cappuccino maker selection \nring (A14) is positioned upwards in the \"HOT MILK\" position.",

    "context": "10. HOW TO MAKE ESPRESSO COFFEE\n10.1 Tips for a hotter coffee\nFor hotter espresso coffee, you should:\n• You are recommended to warm the cups before making \ncoffee by rinsing them with a little hot water.\n• Attach the filter holder to the appliance with the filter in \nplace but without adding coffee. Using the same cup \nas will later be used to make the coffee, press the 1 cup \nbutton and deliver hot water into the cup to heat it.\n• Raise the coffee temperature in the settings menu.\n• Rest the cups you will be using on the cup warmer (A4) \nwhich becomes hot during operation.\n10.2 How to prepare espresso coffee using pre\u0002ground coffee\n1. Place the ground coffee filter (C2 or C3) in the filter holder \n(fig. 6). To make one coffee, use the filter with the \nsymbol on the bottom, to make two coffees, use the filter \nwith the symbol on the bottom.\n2. To make just one coffee, place one level measure of pre\u0002ground coffee (about 7 g) in the filter (fig. 7). To make two \ncoffees, place two loosely filled measures (about 7+7 g) of \npre-ground coffee in the filter. Fill the filter a little at a time \nto prevent the pre-ground coffee from overflowing.\n Important: \nFor correct operation, before filling with pre-ground coffee, \nmake sure there are no coffee residues left in the filter from the \nlast time you made coffee.\n3. Distribute the pre-ground coffee evenly and press lightly \nwith the presser (fig. 8).\nCorrect pressing of the pre-ground coffee is essential to \nobtain a good espresso. If you press too firmly, the coffee \nwill be delivered slowly and will be strong. If you press \ntoo lightly, the coffee will be delivered quickly and will be \nweak.\n4. Remove any excess coffee from the rim of the filter holder \nand attach the filter holder to the appliance. To attach cor\u0002rectly, align the filter holder handle with the INSERT sym\u0002bol (fig. 9), attach the filter holder and rotate the handle \ntowards the right until aligned with the CLOSE symbol.\n5. Place the cup or cups under the filter holder spouts (fig. \n10). \n6. Make sure the lights corresponding to the coffee buttons \nare on, then press the or coffee button. The \nappliance proceeds to make the coffee and delivery is in\u0002terrupted automatically.\n7. To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to \nleft.\n Danger of burns! \nTo avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the \nappliance is delivering coffee. Always wait for a few seconds \nafter delivery.\n10.3 How to make espresso coffee using pods\n Please note: \nUse pods conforming to the ESE standard, indicated on the pack \nby the following symbol. \nThe ESE standard is a system accepted by lead\u0002ing pod producers and enables espresso coffee \nto be prepared simply and cleanly.\n1. Place the filter for coffee pods (with the symbol on \nthe bottom) in the filter holder.\n2. Insert the pod, centring it as far as possible on the filter \n(fig. 11). Always follow the instructions on the pod pack to \nposition the pod on the filter correctly. \nProceed as described in points 4 to 6 in the previous section.\n Please note: \n• While the appliance is making coffee, delivery can be in\u0002terrupted at any moment by pressing the coffee button \npressed previously.\n• At the end of delivery (within 3 seconds), to increase the \namount of coffee in the cup, press and hold the coffee button pressed previously. Delivery is automatically interrupt\u0002ed after a few seconds.\n• To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to \nleft.\n Danger of burns! \nTo avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the \nappliance is delivering coffee.

Turn the steam dial to the position.\n7. Press the button to start descaling.\n8. The descale programme starts and the descaler liquid \ncomes out of the water spout. The descale programme \nremoves limescale deposits from inside the appliance by \nautomatically performing a series of rinses and pausesuntil \nthe tank is completely empty.\n Please note: \nDuring descaling, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of descaler from \nthe boiler outlet.\n9. The appliance stops operation and the orange \nlight continues to flash, indicating that descaling is still \nunderway.\n10. The appliance is now ready for rinsing through with clean \nwater. Extract the water tank, empty, rinse under running \nwater, fill with fresh water up to the MAX level and put \nback in the appliance (If used, insert the water softener \nfilter).\n11. Empty the container used to collect the descaler solution \nand replace it empty under the hot water spout.\n12. Make sure the steam dial is in the position, then \npress the button to start rinsing.\n Please note: \nDuring rinsing, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of water from the \nboiler outlet.\n13. When the water tank is empty, the orange light goes out \nand descaling is complete.\n14. Make sure the steam dial is in the closed position (○\nsymbol).\nThe appliance is ready for use.\n Please note! \n• If the descaling cycle is not completed correctly (e.g. no \nelectricity) we recommend repeating the cycle,\n• If the water tank has not been filled to the MAX level, at the \nend of descaling, the appliance requests a further rinse to \nguarantee that the descaler solution has been completely \neliminated from the machine's internal circuits.\nRepair of damage to the coffee maker caused by limescale is not \ncovered by the guarantee unless descaling is performed regular\u0002ly as described above.",

Turn the steam dial to the position.\n7. Press the button to start descaling.\n8. The descale programme starts and the descaler liquid \ncomes out of the water spout. The descale programme \nremoves limescale deposits from inside the appliance by \nautomatically performing a series of rinses and pausesuntil \nthe tank is completely empty.\n Please note: \nDuring descaling, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of descaler from \nthe boiler outlet.\n9. The appliance stops operation and the orange \nlight continues to flash, indicating that descaling is still \nunderway.\n10. The appliance is now ready for rinsing through with clean \nwater. Extract the water tank, empty, rinse under running \nwater, fill with fresh water up to the MAX level and put \nback in the appliance (If used, insert the water softener \nfilter).\n11. Empty the container used to collect the descaler solution \nand replace it empty under the hot water spout.\n12. Make sure the steam dial is in the position, then \npress the button to start rinsing.\n Please note: \nDuring rinsing, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of water from the \nboiler outlet.\n13.
