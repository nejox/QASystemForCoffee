      "GETTING STARTED Place the machine on a flat surface. When starting the machine for the first time, fill the tank with cold water. Start the machine with the ON/OFF switch. Let a full tank of water pass through the machine once or twice to clean it, without using paper filter or coffee. Making coffee: open the lid and fill the water tank with fresh cold water up to the desired level. There is a water-level indicator for 2–10 big cups / 3–15 small cups inside the water tank. Insert paper filter into filter basket and fill it with ground coffee. There is a gauge for recommended number of spoons of coffee next to the water gauge. For medium-strength coffee, one measuring spoon (approx. 6-7 g) per cup is sufficient. Close the water tank lid and place the jug (complete with lid) onto the warming plate. Start the machine with the ON/OFF switch. The power indicator light will come on and hot water will flow into the filter. When water has stopped flowing, the warming plate keeps the coffee hot until the machine is turned off with the ON/OFF switch. If the machine is not turned off manually, the Safety Auto-Off function turns it off after 40 minutes. If the jug is removed, the filter valve prevents coffee from dripping onto the warming plate. While boiling, the jug must not be removed for longer than 30 seconds or the filter will overflow. The Aroma Selector extends the brewing time to maximize the flavour extraction and get a stronger coffee for a small number of cups (normally less than 6). Press the Aroma button, and the aroma icon will turn on.\n"
