FLASHING Insufficient water in the tank (A9). Fill the tank with water and/or insert it correct- ly, pushing it as far as it will go until it clicks into place. The tank (A9) is not correctly in place. Insert the tank correctly and press as far as it will go. 18 FLASHING The grounds container (A13) is full. Empty the grounds container and drip tray, clean and replace. Important: when removing the drip tray, the grounds container MUST be emptied, even if it contains few grounds. If this is not done, when you make the next coffees, the grounds container may fill up more than expected and clog the machine. After cleaning, the grounds con- tainer has not been replaced (A13). Remove the drip tray and insert the grounds container. FLASHING The grinding is too fine and the coffee is delivered too slowly or not at all. Repeat coffee delivery and turn the grinding adjustment dial (A2, fig. 10) one click clock- wise towards \"7\" while the coffee mill is in operation. If after making at least 2 coffees delivery is still too slow, repeat the correction procedure, turning the grinding adjustment dial another click until delivery is correct (see \"11.3. Adjusting the coffee mill). If the prob- lem persists, turn the steam dial (A19) to the I position and deliver some water from the cappuccino maker. If the water softener filter (C4) is present, an air bubble may have been released inside the circuit, obstructing delivery. Deliver a little water from the cappuccino maker by turning the steam dial (A19) to the I position until the flow is regular (fig. 5). FLASHING The \"pre-ground coffee\" function has been selected without placing any pre-ground coffee in the fun- nel (A6). Place pre-ground coffee in the funnel or dese- lect the “pre-ground” function. FLASHING The machine must be descaled. The descaling procedure described in the sec- tion “15. Descaling\" needs to be performed. FLASHING Too much coffee has been used. Select a milder taste or reduce the quantity of pre-ground coffee, then make the coffee again. 19 FLASHING The coffee beans have run out. Fill beans container. The pre-ground coffee funnel (A6) is clogged. Empty the funnel with the help of a brush as described in the section \"14.8. Cleaning the pre-ground coffee funnel\". FLASHING The infuser has not been replaced after cleaning (A11). Insert the infuser as described in the section “14.9. Cleaning the infuser\". The inside of the appliance is very dirty. Clean the inside of the appliance thoroughly, as described in the section \"14. Cleaning\". If the message is still displayed after cleaning, contact a service centre. 20. TROUBLESHOOTING Below is a list of some of the possible malfunctions. If the problem cannot be resolved as described, contact Customer Services. PROBLEM POSSIBLE CAUSE REMEDY The coffee is not hot. The cups were not preheated. Warm the cups by rinsing them with hot water. Please note: the hot water or rinse function can be used. The infuser has cooled down because 2/3 minutes have elapsed since the last coffee was made. Before making coffee, heat up the infuser by pressing the rinse button. The coffee is weak or not creamy enough. The coffee is ground too coarsely. Turn the grinding dial one click anticlockwise while the grinder is in operation (fig. 8). Con- tinue one click at a time until coffee delivery is satisfactory. The effect is only visible after de- livering 2 coffees (see section \"11.3Adjusting the coffee mill\"). The coffee is unsuitable. Use coffee beans suitable for espresso machines. The coffee is delivered too slowly or a drop at a time. The coffee is ground too finely. Turn the grinding dial one click clockwise while the grinder is in operation (fig. 8). Con- tinue one click at a time until coffee delivery is satisfactory. The effect is only visible after de- livering 2 coffees (see section \"11.3. Adjusting the coffee mill\"). Coffee does not come out of one or both of the spouts. The spouts are blocked. Clean the spouts with a toothpick. 20',\n  'headerChildren': []},\n {'headerId': 20,\n  'headerText': '21.

The flexible mains lead is supplied connected to a B.S. 1363 fused plug having a fuse of 13 amp capacity. Should this plug not fit the socket outlets in your home, it should be cut off and replaced with a suitable plug, following the procedure outlined below. Note: Such a plug cannot be used for any other appliance and should therefore be properly disposed of and not left where children might find it and plug it into a supply socket - with the obvious consequent danger. N.B. We recommend the use of good quality plugs and wall sockets that can be switched off when the machine is not in use. IMPORTANT: the wires in the mains lead fitted to this appliance are coloured in accordance with the following code: GREEN AND YELLOW EARTH BLUE NEUTRAL BROWN LIVE As the colours of the wires in the mains lead of this appliance may not correspond with the coloured markings identifying the terminals in your plug, proceed as follows: - The wire which is coloured green and yellow must be connected to the terminal in the plug which is marked with the letter E or by the earth symbol or coloured green or green and yellow. - The wire which is coloured blue must be connected to the terminal which is marked with the letter N or coloured black. - The wire which is coloured brown must be connected to the terminal which is marked with the letter L or coloured red. When wiring the plug, ensure that all strands of wire are securely retained in each terminal. Do not forget to tighten the mains lead clamp on the plug. If your electricity supply point has only two pin socket outlets, or if you are in doubt, consult a qualified electrician. Should the mains lead ever require replacement, it is essential that this operation be carried out by a qualified electrician and should only be replaced with a flexible cord of the same size. After replacement of a fuse in the plug, the fuse cover must be refitted. If the fuse cover is lost, the plug must not be used until a replacement cover is obtained. The colour of the correct replacement fuse cover is that of the coloured insert in the base of the fuse recess or elsewhere on the plug. Always state this colour when ordering a replacement fuse cover. Only 13amp replacement fuses which are asta approved to B.S. 1362 should be fitted.
